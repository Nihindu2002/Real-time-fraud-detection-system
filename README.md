# Real-time-fraud-detection-system

## 📌 Overview

This project is an end-to-end real-time fraud detection system that identifies and flags suspicious transactions instantly using machine learning.
It simulates live transaction streams, applies feature engineering, handles extreme class imbalance, and returns real-time notifications via dashbaord

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

API: Uvicorn

Dashboard: Streamlit

Model Persistence: Joblib

Version Control: Git, GitHub


## Getting started

1. get the code from the repository

```text
git clone https://github.com/Nihindu2002/Real-time-fraud-detection-system
```
2. [download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanalisiddiqui/fraud-detection-dataset?resource=download) that will be used to train a transaction classifier. Unzip it and put the content (AIML Dataset.csv) under data folder 

3. install required python packages if previously not installed

4. Run dashboard using "streamlit run fraud_detection.py"


## 📊 Results

- High recall for fraud detection

- Stable real-time predictions

- Low false negatives (critical for fraud systems)
